hello-canvas
============

Like "hello, world', but for HTML5 canvas hacking.

Steps to get there:

1. Fork this repository.

2. Point your web browser at your new local copy of index.html. You
should see a circle drifting across the canvas, which turns red when
you touch it with the mouse pointer.

3. Edit hellocanvas.js to make the circle turn green instead.

4. Reload index.html and check that your change worked.

5. Publish your changed version on a website. I like to use
http://wry.me/hacking/ for myself, but if you don't have a site you
can upload files to, here's another way:

  * Commit your change and push to your fork of this repo.

  * Bring up your fork's equivalent of 
    https://github.com/darius/hello-canvas/blob/master/index.html
    in your web browser.

  * See the 'Raw' button just above the HTML text. Click it.

  * In your browser's address bar, there'll be a URL like
    https://raw.github.com/darius/hello-canvas/master/README.md
    Change the "raw.github" to just "rawgithub". This should give
    you a publically sharable, working copy of your changed code.
